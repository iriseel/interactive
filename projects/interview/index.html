        <span class="karen">Karen:</span> Since 2000, I have also been the co- Founder/Artistic Director of Monkeyhouse, an award-winning non profit that connects communities through choreography but I usually refer to myself as a free range collaborator these days because I work at the intersection of many media usually in conjunction with other artists, organizations, and funders. Today I will be jumping between projects that relate to death care workers, a prehistoric butterfly living on Mt Washington, waterways around Deer Island, the history of integrated dance, and holiday headwear for a crew of Guinea pigs,

        For most of my life I was a middle child sandwiched between two very charismatic brothers. I am most at home in groups of people who are passionate about learning with each other. So for example, this weekend two of my dance film collaboration with Nicole Harris, Pane #432.1 and aWays to Fathom: S. Korea edition, will be presented as part of the en route Curbside Performance Series in Biddeford, ME. The whole project is tangled up with regional collaborations. The en route Curbside Performance Series is a collaboration between Engine and Subcircle, two outstanding nonprofits in Maine who often partner with Monkeyhouse. In addition to our dance films, Monkeyhouse will be screening a dance film created by Turning Key dance out of Massachusetts and NSquared Dance in New Hampshire, another dance film developed by Sarah Feinberg in Massachusetts with dancer Elizabeth Powers in Rhode Island set to poetry by Ash Peltz in Oregon, as well as a video essay by Janine Harrington in the UK about her Screen Saver series.

          <span class="siri"></span> Can you talk a little about the Dictionary of Negative Space? What brought you to the project? How has it grown over time? 
      </p>

      <p>
          <span class="karen"></span> The Dictionary of Negative Space began while I was in graduate school at Sierra Nevada College’s MFA program in Interdisciplinary Arts (which is being merged into the University of Nevada Reno this year). I began the MFA program with the very first cohort in 2015 about three years after my mother, father, and older brother were killed in a grisly car crash. 
          
          <span class="ns_center">&nbsp;</span>
      
          Meeting so many new people at this time highlighted the challenges that I had been experiencing since the crash. Talking about my life and my work was filled with awkward pauses where I tried to find the words to explain things. I finally realized that the problem was not in my brain but rather was the lack of words in the English language to articulate ideas related to grief, trauma, and repair.

      <p>
          S: Why do you think the English language lacks so many terms to grapple with loss and mourning? Have you come across terms in other languages that describe an experience lacking expression in English?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        S: A dictionary without names for its entries is a rather paradoxical object. How do you see this friction working?
      </p>


        <div class="ns_right"></div>
      <p>
          S: Cross-referencing between entries seems to play an important role in the dictionary. Could you speak a little about how citation and hyperlinking function there?
      </p>

      <p>
          S: What role do the illustrations — images, audio clips, short stories etc. — that accompany the dictionary entries play?
      </p>

      <p>
        S: Is there an entry and/or illustration that is especially important to you?
      </p>

      <p>
        S: Has there been a moment in the process of making the dictionary that stays with you in particular?
      </p>

      <p>
          S: What have you found to be the most fruitful outgrowths of the dictionary? The most surprising? 
      </p>

      <p>
          S: What are some other works (writing, video, performances etc.) on grief and memory that you find interesting to think about?
      </p>
      
      <p>
        S: What are some of your favorite images/words/videos/objects/things that exist?
      </p>

      <p>
        S: It seems that community, collaboration, mentorship, and choreography also play a very important role in your work. How do these practices relate to each other and to your work on grief and loss?
      </p>

      <p>
        S: How do chickens figure in your practice?
      </p>

      <p>
        S: What else are you working on now?
      </p>

      <p>
        S: What is a question you would love to be asked of you?
      </p>

      <p>
        S: How would you answer that question?
      </p>
